**Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark & PCAP**
This project demonstrates a detailed analysis of network traffic using tcpdump and Wireshark, focusing on identifying suspicious or malicious activity within a PCAP file. The goal is to simulate tasks typically performed by a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst, such as detecting anomalies, filtering malicious traffic, and reporting findings.
